Little Image Printer is an app for iOS that will allow you to take photos on your iOS device, make some basic adjustments and send them to your Little Printer using BERG Cloud's Direct Print API.

The original app was put together in approximately five and a half hours at the Little Printer Hack Day, hosted by BERG in London on the 2nd March 2013. Many thanks to BERG for hosting the day and providing the pizza, it was great fun. 

Little Image Printer development is ongoing - the goal here being to transform the app from a quick hack into something more generally useful.
