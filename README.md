Little Image Printer is an app for iOS that will allow you to take photos on your iOS device, make some basic adjustments and send them to your Little Printer using BERG Cloud's Direct Print API.

The original app was put together in approximately five and a half hours at the Little Printer Hack Day, hosted by BERG in London on the 2nd March 2013. Many thanks to BERG for hosting the day and providing the pizza, it was great fun. 

Given the time constraints under which it was built, it's still all a bit rough and ready, so here are a few quick notes:

- Deployment target is set to iOS 6.1 right now. That's not really essential, it should (I think) be fine under 5.0, probably even 4.3.
- It's nominally a universal app, but only the iPhone UI has been built so far.
- The UI is, shall we say, 'basic'

Whilst the app is perfectly functional, it should be regarded as a work in progress.
