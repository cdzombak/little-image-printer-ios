        <p>Little Image Printer first came to life at the Little Printer Hack Day hosted by BERG on 2nd March 2013. Put together in around five and a half hours, the first cut was a little rough around the edges, but was completed in time to demo at the end of the day. Since then, the app has been tidied, polished a little and made a little more presentable, ready for release to the world.</p>
        
        <p>If you're a developer and want to take a look behind the scenes, all of the Little Image Printer source code can be found over on github at <a href="https://github.com/dopiaza/little-image-printer-ios">https://github.com/dopiaza/little-image-printer-ios</a>.</p>
      <h2>Credits</h2>
      
      <p>Many thanks to the great people at BERG for bringing Little Printer into the world and putting the BERG Cloud together. Thanks too for organising the Hack Day that resulted in the creation of this app and, most importantly, for providing the beer and pizza that sustained us during the day.</p>
